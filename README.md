notes from a class I taught on stellar structure and evolution, cosmology and general relativity. Texts referred to were "The physical Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy" by Frank Shu, "An introduction to the study of stellar structure" by S. Chandrsekhar (and several other of Chandrasekhar's wonderful textbooks), "The mathematical theory of relativity" Sir Arthur Eddington, "Gravitation and Cosmology" by S. Weinberg and "Relativity, Thermodynamics and Cosmology" by Richard Tolman
