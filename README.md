notes on integral and differential forms of maxwell's equations for fields and potentials and 
the derivations of wave equations for light

notes from a class I taught on stellar structure and evolution, cosmology and general relativity. Texts referred to were "The physical Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy" by Frank Shu, "An introduction to the study of stellar structure" by S. Chandrsekhar (and several other of Chandrasekhar's wonderful textbooks), "The mathematical theory of relativity" Sir Arthur Eddington, "Gravitation and Cosmology" by S. Weinberg and "Relativity, Thermodynamics and Cosmology" by Richard Tolman

The notes had to be divided into 5 files, of ~ 60 pages each, due to the document feed limitations.
