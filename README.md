the derivations of wave equations for light

notes from a class I taught on stellar structure and evolution, cosmology and general relativity. Texts referred to were "The physical Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy" by Frank Shu, "An introduction to the study of stellar structure" by S. Chandrsekhar (and several other of Chandrasekhar's wonderful textbooks), "The mathematical theory of relativity" Sir Arthur Eddington, "Gravitation and Cosmology" by S. Weinberg and "Relativity, Thermodynamics and Cosmology" by Richard Tolman

The notes had to be divided into 5 files, of ~ 60 pages each, due to the document feed limitations. The first 8 pages of v1 should be skipped, I realized later they were pages I had removed from the lectures over time. The first valid page has "AST 3033" in the upper left hand corner and is the initial syllabus. The notes were xeroxed and given to the students as writing this stuff down during class was not reasonable. The survivors all got As.
